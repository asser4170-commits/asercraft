# Blocky Frontier

Blocky Frontier is an original, legal voxel sandbox prototype inspired by the *genre* of early block-building games.

## Goals

- Keep the project original (code, branding, and behavior)
- Showcase chunkless block placement/removal with a simple terrain seed
- Provide a tiny starter architecture that is easy to expand

## Run locally

Because this project imports ES modules from a CDN, run it with a local web server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open <http://localhost:4173>.

## Controls

- Orbit camera: drag with mouse
- Left click: remove selected block
- Right click: place currently selected block
- `1`, `2`, `3`: choose block type

## Legal note

This project intentionally avoids copying proprietary source code, assets, and branding from any commercial game.
